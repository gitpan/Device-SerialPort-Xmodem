=head1 NAME

Device::SerialPort::Xmodem - Xmodem file transfer protocol for Device::SerialPort

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Device::SerialPort::Xmodem;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an Xmodem implementation designed to receive a file using 128
byte blocks. This module is intended to be passed an open and prepared
port with active connection.

At this time it can only receive 128 byte blocks, however 1k blocks are
in the works. I do plan to write a send functionality soon.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
